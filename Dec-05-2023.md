# 关于非托管钱包如何迁移账户（密钥）
> 一直好奇 metamask 是如何在设备间做密钥迁移

## 加密货币钱包
加密货币钱包帮助我们“记忆”密钥，包含公钥和私钥。公钥是钱包的地址，私钥用于交易签名。私钥非常重要，因为得到它的人可以任意的操作我们的money。
## 托管钱包 vs 非托管钱包
> 托管钱包由第三方托管，为您存储密钥。这可能是一家提供企业级数据安全系统的公司，企业使用它来保存和保护数据。一些加密货币交易所为其客户提供托管钱包。非托管钱包是您负责保护密钥的钱包。这是设备上大多数加密货币钱包的类型。

托管钱包 = 中心化的 server 帮我们保管密钥。 - 不言而喻的中心化风险。
非托管钱包 = 由自己保管密钥。
## metamask 如何保存密钥
metamask 如何创建账户：
1. 从预先准备的单词库中生成唯一的单词 list，作为 recovery phrase。
2. BIP-39 算法根据 recovery phrase 生成密钥。

所以其实不存在迁移钱包，而是由我们的大脑->手完成 recovery phrase 的迁移，然后 metamask 重新生成一次密钥罢了。嗯，的确是高明的办法。不过有一个缺点哈：
**千万不要忘记自己的 recovery phrase！！！**

## 总结
非托管钱包不迁移密钥。当我们在新设备上输入 recovery phrase 时，钱包通过此 recovery phrase 生成同样的密钥，从而达到迁移的目的。

Metamask being a non-custodial wallet means it doesn't store your private keys on its servers. Instead, it generates and manages these keys within the browser extension or app on your device. When you set up Metamask, it creates a unique seed phrase, also known as a recovery phrase or mnemonic phrase. This phrase is a sequence of words that serves as a backup for your private keys.

When you want to transfer your wallet from one device to another, you can use this seed phrase. By entering the seed phrase during the setup of Metamask on the new device, the wallet can be regenerated with the same private keys. This allows you to access your cryptocurrency holdings and transaction history on the new device without the need for any data transfer between the devices or relying on a centralized server.

Remember, it's crucial to keep your seed phrase secure and private. Anyone with access to this phrase can potentially access your funds, so it's best kept offline, written down in a secure location, and not shared with anyone.

does metamask use some well known algo to calculate the private keys from the recovery phrase?

Metamask, like many other cryptocurrency wallets, follows a standard protocol for deriving private keys from the recovery phrase. It uses a hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet structure based on a standardized algorithm called BIP-39 (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 39) for generating the seed phrase and BIP-32 for deriving hierarchical deterministic wallets.

BIP-39 defines a method for creating a mnemonic phrase (the recovery phrase) from a set of predefined words. This phrase is then used to create a seed that acts as the root for generating a hierarchical tree of keys. BIP-32 outlines how child keys (both private and public) are derived from the seed, enabling multiple key pairs to be generated deterministically from the original seed.

The process involves multiple steps of hashing and derivation using cryptographic algorithms. When you input the recovery phrase into Metamask or any wallet that adheres to these standards, it follows these algorithms to derive the keys and addresses associated with your wallet.

This standardized approach ensures interoperability and compatibility between different wallets that support the same standards, allowing users to recover their wallets across various platforms that implement BIP-39 and BIP-32.
