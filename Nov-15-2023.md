# CSS-Module vs CSS-in-JS vs Atomic CSS

When an web app is being developed, the most common problem is style contamination.
> The color of card text is overwrited by an style of container because the class names of both are `.content`.

There are many ways to fix this problem and the most common used one is adding an extra `!important` to the color rule of the card.  This works sometimes but not always good.  In order to understand why, please spent 1 min to think about why this issue would happen.

```css
// card.css
.content {
  color: red;
}
```

```html
<div class="card">
  <div class="content">...</div>
</div>
```

```css
// container.css
.content {
  color: gray;
}
```

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="content">...</div>
</div>
```

Yes, the answer is the css styles are not quite scoped.


## What is scoped styles
The scoped styles are styles that scoped to the specify component and no other component get affected.

Unfortunately, there is no native support of scoped styles.

## what is CSS Module?
> A [CSS Module](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) is a CSS file in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default.
The steps to use `CSS Module` in your app:
1. the name of the css source file should be like `card.module.css`

```css
.content {
  color: red;
}
```
2.  the compiler will compile this file and output an object of mapping from origin class names to unique class names.
```json
{
  "content": "content_hash_string"
}
```
The css content will be like:
```css
 .content_hash_string {
   color: red;
}
```
3. the user assigns the unique class names to the html.

In this way of `CSS Module`, the styles were scoped to the unique class name and assigned to the specify html markups. The benifits is it's never been a problem to manage the class name of CSS.

## what is CSS-in-JS?
`CSS-in-JS` is an approuch to manage css right in the JS source file such as a React component. It does a very good job on scoped-css.  

One of the popular solution of `CSS-in-JS` is [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction). Here is the sample snippets of using that in react app.
```typescript
import { css } from '@emotion/css'

render(
  <div
    id="card"
    className={css`
      color: red;
    `}
  >
    <div class="content">...</div>
  </div>
)
```

The benifts:
1. the styles are right in the place where it get effected and make it's easy to dev & debug. You don't need to open two tabs in the editor to compare whether the `selectors`/`styles` are ok.
2. the styles are just template literals and it can be updated very easy(copy from figma and just save it, inject states using `${}`).

## What is Atomic CSS framework?
> `Atomic CSS` is the approach to CSS architecture that favors small, single-purpose classes with names based on visual function.

`Atomic CSS`  is not scoped like two solutions above, but it has no issue of style contamination since it is single-purpose.  Let's see how single-purpose css resolve the issue of style contamination.

```html
# card

<div class="card">
  <div class="content color-red">...</div>
</div>

# container

<div class="container">
  <div class="content color-blue">...</div>
</div>
```

`Atomic CSS`  is, essentially, a convenient way to use more specific class names in the html markups instead of naming the set of styles individually.

The benifits compare to `CSS-in-JS`:
1.  Performance. it is pure css(more specificly, the compiled output is pure CSS) so no runtime needed. 
2. Design system. Most of the `CSS-in-JS` framework supports built in design tokens.
